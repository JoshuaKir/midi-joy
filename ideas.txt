allow one button to have multiple maps: ie play a chord

axis can have axis or button mode
-button mode would require threshold to then trigger note
-maybe then can join when threshold and button is held, play note
-this is guitar hero mode

light up mode that lights each botton when you hit it like a midi fighter

Make each active controller it's own window with solo and mute buttons. As well as save/load buttons
maybe look into creating my own midi ports and allowing each controller to have a seperate port
-then you could have multiple ports per single controller and those cna be different mappings
--would aid in swithcing layouts via muting and unmuting





--for later:
could i use hid to make midi port thing like loop midi
hid for device, mido for sending midi out
